Objective:
10 Add event listener to detect keyboard strokes					//Main logic: add event listner to entire document



Use same method addEventListener and add to entire document instead of specific button/element
Once element was detected, function gets called passing in the event that triggered the key press
Event contains property  called key which tells which keyboard key was pressed which is passed to makesound()

we clicked earlier
How to get keyboard event?



keydown event listener

mdn -> Web -> Events 
Find list of events

____________________________________


1) target the key press event
//earlier we added event listener to:
	document.querySelectorAll(".drum)[i].addEventListener("click", function())	//Earlier we added event listener to button
			when is event listener triggered? when button pressed

					//How to add event listener to keyboard //by adding to entire document
	document.addEventListener("keypress", function()) {	/?Entire webpage starts listening for  keyboard strokes
		alert("key was pressed");
}

Implement:
on page tap on any key -> get alert -> key was pressed

How Figure out which key was perssed? using event
once event happens, element triggers the function
What if we pass parameter into function


document.addEventListener("keypress", function(event)) {	/?Entire webpage starts listening for  keyboard strokes
		console.log(event);		//Can we use any other keyword instead of event? Yes e, evt anything works
}

Output: 
//All information related to the keypress
KeyboardEvent {isTrusted: true, key:"l", code:"KeyL", location: 0, ctrlKey: false, ...}

Check MDN -> keypress events -> lot of properties
	one is : key //tells which key value got tapped, we need this

both 1 and 2 make use of makeSound()
1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//our switch cases are inside button listener for button clicks
//Create a function that takes a character and checks against switch statement to play correct sound
//Call it inside event listener for key press
//And event listener for drum buttons

document.querySelectorAll(".drum")[i].addEventListener("click", function(){

//fetch what button was pressed
//Detecting Button Press

var buttonInnerHTML = this.innerHTML;	//if button pressed check innerhtml
					//send it to makeSound() to make relevant sound
					
makeSound(buttonInnerHTML);	//pass in that key
				//In JS can pass functions as parameters and functions as callbacks(include things we get back after event has happened)

2) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Afterwards call it inside event listener for keypress
//Detecting Keyboard Press

And event listener for drum buttons
				//If keypress detected send event.key property
document.addEventListener("keypress", function(event)) {	/?Entire webpage starts listening for  keyboard strokes
		console.log(event);	//
		call makeSound(event.key)	//use event.key 
}

//Creating that function
function makeSound(key) {
switch(key) {	//instead of switching on buttonInnerHTML , we switch on key
