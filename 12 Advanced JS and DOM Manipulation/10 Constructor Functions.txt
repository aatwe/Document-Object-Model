We declared the JS object
var bellBoy1 = {
   name: "Timmy",
   age: 19,
   hasWorkPermit: true,
   languages: ["French", "English"],

//  Name	    Colon	function() {}
   moveSuitcase: function() {
                alert("May I take your suitcase/");
    	pickUpSuitcase();
                move();
   
   }
}

Now we try to add this method to constructor function
How to use this method with constructor function?



function BellBoy (name,age,hasWorkPermit, languages) {
   this.name = name;
   this.age    = age;
    this.hasWorkPermit = hasWorkPermit;
    this.languages = languages;
    this.moveSuitcase = function() {
  	alert("May I take your suitcase?");
	pickUpSuitcase();
	move();
}
}


what advantage of using this method in constructor function over JS object?
you create an object using constructor, all will have function moveSuitcase

Ex challenge

Given 
function Housekeeper (yearsOfExperience, name, cleaningRepertoire) {
  this.yearsOfExperience = yearsOfExperience;
  this.name = name;
   this.cleaningRepertoire = cleaningRepertoire
}
Add method to housekeeper constructor function named as clean
method will just send alert saying cleaning in progress
Create new housekeeper from the consturctor function and call cleaning method associated with that object

function Housekeeper (yearsOfExperience, name, cleaningRepertoire) {
  this.yearsOfExperience = yearsOfExperience;
  this.name = name;
   this.cleaningRepertoire = cleaningRepertoire
	alert.("Cleaning in progress...");
	}

var houseKeeper1 = new Housekeeper(12, "James", {"bedroom"});
houseKeeper1.clean();



//note
this is similar to 

var tom1 = new Audio("sounds/tom-1.mp3");	//call constructor to create new object by giving location
tom1.play();				//call play method
break;

imagine what constructor function will look like for this audio JS object

function Audio (fileLocation) {
  this.fileLocation = fileLocation;
  this.play=  function(){
	//tap into audio hardware
	//check if file exists
	//check if file is soundfile
	//play soundfile
}
}
