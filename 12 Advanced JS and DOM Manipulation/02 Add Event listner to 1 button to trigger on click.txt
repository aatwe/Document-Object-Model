Objective: Trigger a funtion when a button is clicked



index.js

//1) Create function that should trigger on click

function handleClick() {
   alert("I got clicked")
}

//How to trigger this function when clicked?Add event listener
Where to find? MDN 
					//event to listen to, listener

//2) Add event listener to button to register click
	event to listen to= click  ,  listener = handleClick function


document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", handleClick)
	why no () in function call
		it will directly call function on loading website/event listener is added
	by passing by name only, we will wait for it to call when event listener is called

//Can also write this way
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", function() {
	alert("I got clicked");
})
