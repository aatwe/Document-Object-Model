Debugger is used to find what is wrong in codes
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

function multiply(num1, num2) {
    return num1*num2;
}

function calculator(num1, num2, operator){
   return  operator(num1, num2)
}

calculator(4,5,add);
>9
calculator(4,5,multiply)
>20

//Use debugger
